    <h1 class="large">Why is cyberbullying so focused on kids than adults?</h1>
    <p>
      Well the reason is simple, it is because children are more likely to form
      long term impacts, which is what the bullies want. I’m not saying that
      adults don’t get cyberbullied, in the US, 40% of adults have experienced
      some form of online harassment. But these impacts to adults usually go
      away quickly, as they don’t really take things personally.
